# Web Scraper

A web scraper web application that scrapes player scores and statistics for belgian football players abroad. 
I like to follow some of the young, talented football players that play in foreign leagues. 
I looked up stats and scores via goal.com, so during my Hacker School experience I wrote a web scraper that downloaded statistics and scores for all players. 
I extended this scraper by plugging the results into a Mongo database and deployed it to Heroku. A crontab updated the results automatically (but is discontinued for the moment).

## To do

Improve the lay-out of the websites using CSS and start the updating process again.
